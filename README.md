## My process

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I lerrned alot from the first chalange which i used to, making corrections and applying them to this challange. in this challange i encounted a new styling element which alows me to make my webpage responsive in mobile, tablet and desktop mode. Puting this into use was very exciting. It also alloud me to make changes to my html element when its on the active state.
 See some code snippets below:

```html
<h1><b>HTML & CSS foundations</b></h1>
```
```css
h1:active:hover{
     color: rgb(252, 225, 155); 
 }

 @media(min-width: 1441px) {
    .me{
     max-width: 1440px;
     padding: 32px;
 }
}

```
Taking these challanges have helped me alot the pass few days, finding an uncovering new ways of styling elements to my taste. Cant wait for what comes next....ðŸ˜Ž

### Continued development
I'll focuse more on my webdevelopmet, even though its been long since i visited it, but with this challanges i might just be able to get back on track.
